# Moai Music Tools
This website is a collection of my favourite and most used tools for making electronic based music.

Its built using node-js for app routes, vanilla javascript for the musical logic/calculation brain and deployed via Heroku & Github. 

## TODO
The jQuery slider in the 'BPM calculator' works erratically when using a touch screen to narrow in on a number. Works best when using a key board arrow. 

The logic in the guitar scales passes all tests so far but havent been able to check all various guitar tunings yet.
